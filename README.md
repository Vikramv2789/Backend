# HTTP Backend Project - 20 points #

## Directions: ## 
Build the back end service of a music app. The app organizes its content by genres: pop, hip hop, rap, classical, rock, jazz, blues, and electronic. 
You are to build the endpoints of this application using HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests to simulate how to manage the database. ( no actual database here, just arrays)
All operations related to music genres will be done by sending HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests to this endpoint in order to get, create, update and detele data.

Tools needed: vsCode, Chrome browser, Postman and (optional) Nodemon utility.

RUBRIC: 5 points each properly coded route
* http route for GET requests 
* http route for POST requests  
* http route for PUT requests  
* http route for DELETE requests  
Extra credit +1 point for more features in the code that enhance the service.
